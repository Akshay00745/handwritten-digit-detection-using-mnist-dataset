# 🧠 MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **handwritten digit recognition system** built using **Keras (TensorFlow backend)** and the **MNIST dataset**.  
It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify digits (0–9) from images, and includes a **Tkinter-based GUI** where users can draw digits and get real-time predictions.
